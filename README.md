# **Module 2 Challenge - VBA**
## Using VBA to analyze stocks dataset to determine returns  - the pros and cons of refactoring of code is also discussed and illustrated in this challenge.

## **1. Overview of Project**
### This project is made up of three main parts:
### a) Using the 2017 and 2018 stock datasets provided to calculate the percentage returns of a list of stocks 
### b) Demonstrate the use of VBA code to format worksheets, to create Message Boxes, the use of Input Boxes and Display Boxes, use of arrays, loops and ifs statements in VBA code
### c) Discuss the pros and cons of refactoring in coding by using illustrations from this project


## **2. Analysis of Stocks for 2017 and 2018**

### Using VBA code, the 2017 & 2018 stocks dataset was analyzed in the following manner:
### a) Use of an Input Message Box to allow the client to select for which year he wants to do the analysis 
### b) The VBA code uses the following concepts to collect data, such as ticker symbol, starting price and ending price each stock ticker symbol 

####    Arrays - used to collect the data about each stock
####    Loops - used to iterate through every single row of the dataset 
####    Ifs statements - to validate and send specific data meeting certain conditions to the array for subsequent reporting
