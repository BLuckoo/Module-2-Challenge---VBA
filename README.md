# **Module 2 Challenge - VBA**
## Using VBA to analyze stocks dataset to determine returns  - the pros and cons of refactoring of code is also discussed and illustrated in this challenge.

## **1. Overview of Project**
### This project is made up of three main parts:
### a) Using the 2017 and 2018 stock datasets provided to calculate the percentage returns of a list of stocks 
### b) Demonstrate the use of VBA code to format worksheets, to create Message Boxes, the use of Input Boxes and Display Boxes, use of arrays, loops and ifs statements in VBA code
### c) Discuss the pros and cons of refactoring in coding by using illustrations from this project

## **2. Analysis of Stocks for 2017 and 2018

### Using VBA code, the 2017 & 2018 stocks dataset was analyzed in the following manner:
### a) Use of an Input Message Box to allow the client to select which year he wants to do the analysis for
